========

It's always easy to learn from examples. Below are some useful examples of how 
to use the pansys python module.

If you are working interactively with pansys, its recommended to use a 
``jupyter-notebook`` or a ``jupyter-console``. The interactivity provided by these
interfaces is much better than using a python interpretter. 

All the examples shown have been created using ``jupyter-notebook``
